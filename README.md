# ⚗️ Gold Physics: Koopman Blackbox Engine

> **"The math is universal, but the source code is proprietary."**

Welcome to the **Digital Asset Physics Lab**. This repository hosts the compiled **High-Frequency Analysis Engine** designed to detect market instability in Gold (XAU/USD) using *Koopman Operator Theory*.

## 📦 What is this?

This is a **Blackbox Software Delivery**.
Inside this repository, you will find `engine_core.pyd`. This is not a normal Python file; it is a **compiled binary** (written in C, wrapped in Python).

* ✅ **Usable:** You can import it and calculate risk scores.
* 🔒 **Protected:** You cannot open it to see the mathematical formula.
* 🚀 **Fast:** It runs at C-level speed, much faster than standard Python.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

**System Requirements:**
* OS: Windows (x64)
* Python: 3.13 (Must match the compiler version)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
