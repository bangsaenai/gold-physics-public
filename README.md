# ⚗️ Gold Physics: Koopman Blackbox Engine

> **"The math is universal, but the source code is proprietary."**

Welcome to the **Digital Asset Physics Lab**. This repository hosts the compiled **High-Frequency Analysis Engine** designed to detect market instability in Gold (XAU/USD) using *Koopman Operator Theory*.

## 📦 What is this?

This is a **Blackbox Software Delivery**.
Inside this repository, you will find `engine_core.pyd`. This is not a normal Python file; it is a **compiled binary** (written in C, wrapped in Python).

* ✅ **Usable:** You can import it and calculate risk scores.
* 🔒 **Protected:** You cannot open it to see the mathematical formula.
* 🚀 **Fast:** It runs at C-level speed, much faster than standard Python.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

**System Requirements:**
* OS: Windows (x64)
* Python: 3.13 (Must match the compiler version)

🚀 Next Mission: The "Service Provider" Challenge
Coming Soon (Next Class):

Currently, you are the Consumer of this technology. In the next workshop, you will transform into the Creator.

Your Objective:

Ideation: Design your own financial microservice (e.g., RSI Calculator, Currency Converter, Simple AI).

Production: Learn how to use Cython and Visual Studio Build Tools to compile your Python code into a .pyd file.

Protection: Hide your source code (.py) and deliver only the binary product (.pyd).

Distribution: Upload your blackbox engine to your own GitHub as a proprietary software vendor.

Prepare your VS Code and get ready to compile!
